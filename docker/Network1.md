Using the host network in Docker Compose allows a container to use the network stack of the host system instead of isolating it within its own network namespace. This can be useful in cases where you need to access services running on the host or when you want to avoid port mapping and network address translation. In this answer, we will explore how to utilize the host network in Docker Compose.
Option 1: Using the network_mode directive

One way to utilize the host network in Docker Compose is by using the network_mode
directive. This directive allows you to specify the network mode for a service, and by setting it to “host”, the container will share the network namespace with the host. Here’s an example of how to use it in a Docker Compose file:
version: "3"
services:
  myservice:
    image: myservice:latest
    network_mode: host

In this example, the myservice
service will use the host network. Any ports exposed by the container will be directly accessible on the host system.

Option 2: Using the network option

Another way to utilize the host network in Docker Compose is by using the network
option with the value set to “host”. This option allows you to specify a network for a service, and by setting it to “host”, the container will use the host network. Here’s an example of how to use it in a Docker Compose file:
version: "3"
services:
  myservice:
    image: myservice:latest
    networks:
      - host
networks:
  host:
    external: true

In this example, the myservice
service will use the host network. The networks
section defines a network called “host” and sets it as an external network. This allows the container to use the host network without creating a new network namespace.
Best practices and considerations

When utilizing the host network in Docker Compose, there are some best practices and considerations to keep in mind:

1. Security: Using the host network allows the container to directly access services running on the host. Ensure that the container and the services it interacts with are properly secured to prevent unauthorized access.

2. Port conflicts: When using the host network, be cautious of potential port conflicts. Since the container will use the same network stack as the host, any ports exposed by the container must not conflict with any services running on the host.

3. Network isolation: Utilizing the host network removes the network isolation provided by Docker’s default bridge network. This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage depending on the use case. Ensure that the benefits of using the host network outweigh the loss of network isolation.

4. Compatibility: Not all features of Docker networking may be available when using the host network. Some features, such as service discovery or load balancing, may require the use of Docker’s internal networking capabilities.

5. Performance: Using the host network can provide better performance compared to using Docker’s internal networking, especially for high-performance applications that rely heavily on network communication.

6. Testing and development: Utilizing the host network can be useful during testing and development, as it allows for easier access to host services and eliminates the need for port mapping.

Overall, the decision to utilize the host network in Docker Compose should be based on the specific requirements and constraints of your application. Consider the security implications, potential port conflicts, network isolation needs, compatibility requirements, performance considerations, and the ease of testing and development when making this decision.
