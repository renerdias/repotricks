Set up Docker's apt repository.

# Add Docker's official GPG key:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
```sh
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

> [!NOTE]
> 
>  If you use a derivative distro, such as Kali Linux, you may need to substitute the part of this command that's expected to print the version codename:
> 
>  (. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")
>
>  Replace this part with the codename of the corresponding Debian release, such as bookworm.
